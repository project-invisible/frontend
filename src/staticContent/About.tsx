            IN_VISIBLE is a project founded ba Kamalanetra AJ C Hung with the
            intention to improve inclusion and visibility of trans*, intersex
            and non-binary (TIN) people at public spaces institutions and
            services. The IN_VISIBLE prototype is developed by students of the
            International Media Informatics at the HTW Berlin in close
            cooperation with Ren√©_ Rain Hornstein, Kamalanetra AJ C Hung and
            supervised by Prof. Barne Kleinen. With the help of contextual
            design techniques, requirements were identified, which were
            implemented with aReact frontend, leaflet map, a Spring
            Micro-Service (Java) backend and MongoDB as database.
            <br />
            <br />
            The prototype IN_VISIBLE is an interactive visualisation tool, which
            shows the changing landscape of access, inclusion and exclusion from
            academic institutions for transgender communities. The tool offers
            TIN-people the opportunity to share positive and negative
            experiences from public institutions and to evaluate them in terms
            of their TIN-friendliness. The aim of the project is to increase the
            visibility of discriminatory and unfair treatment of TIN people and
            trace it back to the institutions, but also to create a platform for
            exchanging experiences within the TIN community.
